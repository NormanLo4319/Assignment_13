        <h2>Correlations Discovered Bewtween Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
        <p>This assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates, which includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state.</p>

          <h2>Health Care Vs. Poverty</h2>
          <p>In this graph, we are observing the correlation between lack of health care and poverty at the state level. 
            There is a upward trend that we can observe from the graph, which suggest a possible positive correlation between the lack 
            of health care and poverty at the state level.  The higher ratio of poverty is correlated with the higher level of lack of health care.

          <h2>Health Care Vs. Age</h2>
          <p>Below graph demonstrates the possible correlation between lack of health care and median age at the state level. 
            As shown in the graph, the states with younger population record higher levels of lack of health care compare to states with older population. 
            This could be explained by the allocation of health care is more distributed to the states with the aging population.

          <h2>Obesity Rate Vs. Smoke</h2>
          <p>The last graph represents the high correlation between smoking and obesity at the state level.  As observed in the graph, 
            there is a clear path of the plots that demonstrates a positive correlation between smoking and obesity.
            In fact, it is a well-known issue in our country. Smoking is related to many of the chronicle diseases and obesity is one of the many.
